# ITEM - shops will use a specified item as the currency (default is Emerald). To change this item in-game, run the

# VAULT - shops will use Vault as the currency. (This requires Vault to be installed on the server)
# EXPERIENCE - shops will use experience points as the currency

# name :
# This is the name of the currency that shows up on signs. If you are using ITEM, you will want to change

# format :
# This is the order in which prices are displayed. For example, if you are using ITEM with Emeralds as the currency,
# '[price] [name]' would show '5 Emerald(s)'. If you are using VAULT, this would show '5 $', so setting this as
# '[name][price]' would show '$5'.
