# General Settings

## usePermissions
This setting determines whether the plugin uses the permission system to control access to features.
```yaml
usePermissions: true
```

This setting governs how Shop handles player permissions throughout the plugin, affecting almost every aspect of shop creation, management, and usage.

When set to `true`:
- The plugin will check for specific permissions before allowing players to perform actions
- Players will by default have NO permissions to create or use shops
- Permissions must be explicitly granted using a permissions plugin (like LuckPerms)
- Shop owners need appropriate permissions (e.g., `shop.create.buy`, `shop.create.sell`)
- Shop customers need appropriate permissions (e.g., `shop.use.buy`, `shop.use.sell`)
- Build limits can be set using permissions like `shop.buildlimit.10` (limits to 10 shops)
- Using `shop.operator` permission grants full access to all plugin features

When set to `false`:
- All players can create and use any type of shop without permission checks
- Only gamble shop creation remains restricted to operators
- Admin commands (like setcurrency, itemrefresh, reload) remain restricted to operators
- WorldGuard and Towny hooks still respect operator status

This setting is particularly important for server administrators who want granular control over shop privileges. For example, you might want to restrict certain shop types to VIP players, or limit how many shops each player can create based on their rank.

## checkUpdates
This setting enables or disables update notifications for server operators when they log in.
```yaml
checkUpdates: true
```

This setting controls whether the plugin checks for and notifies about available updates. When enabled, Shop will connect to SpigotMC.org to check if a newer version is available.

When set to `true`:
- The plugin will check SpigotMC.org for updates at regular intervals
- If a newer version is found, a notification will be sent to the console
- Server operators (OPs) will receive a clickable notification when they log in, with a link to download the update
- If you're running a development or pre-release version (higher version number than the latest stable release), a different notification will indicate you're using a development build

When set to `false`:
- No update checks will be performed
- No notifications will be sent to operators or the console

This feature is useful for staying informed about new versions that may include bug fixes, performance improvements, or new features. The update check is performed asynchronously so it doesn't impact server performance. Please leave this enabled.

## enableGUI 
This enables a graphical user interface to use all shop features without typing commands.
```yaml
enableGUI: true
```

This setting controls whether players can access and use the plugin's graphical user interface. The GUI provides an intuitive, menu-based approach to using all shop features without needing to remember commands.

When set to `true`:
- Typing `/shop` (or your custom command alias) without any arguments opens the GUI
- Players can browse all shops, search for specific items, manage their own shops, and access settings through interactive menus
- Features are organized in tabs for easy navigation
- The GUI makes the plugin more accessible to players who are unfamiliar with commands
- All shop types and management functions are available through the interface

When set to `false`:
- The GUI is completely disabled

The GUI is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, making it easier for players to discover and use shop features. Most server owners will want to keep this enabled as it significantly improves the player experience.

## commandAlias
This is the command alias that will be used as the base for all shop commands.
```yaml
commandAlias: shop
```

This setting determines the primary command that players will use to interact with the Shop plugin. It defines the base command that all other subcommands will extend from.

When you set this value:
- Players will use `/<your_alias>` as the main command (e.g., `/shop list`, `/shop currency`)
- The GUI will be accessible via `/<your_alias>` if the GUI is enabled
- Tab completion will work with your custom alias

Common examples of alternative values:
- `market` (players would use `/market` instead of `/shop`)
- `trade` (players would use `/trade` instead of `/shop`)
- `store` (players would use `/store` instead of `/shop`)

Changing this can be useful to:
- Avoid command conflicts with other plugins
- Create more intuitive commands that match your server's theme
- Provide language-specific commands for international servers

Remember that changing this value affects all documentation and guides for your players, so you may need to update any server guides or tutorials accordingly.

## deletePlayerShopsAfterXHoursOffline
This will permanently delete a player's shops if they have not logged onto the server after X hours. Set this to 0 to never auto-delete a player's shops.
```yaml
deletePlayerShopsAfterXHoursOffline: 0
```

This setting enables automatic cleanup of shops belonging to players who haven't logged into your server for an extended period. It can help keep your server tidy by removing inactive shops and potentially improve performance by reducing the number of shops that need to be processed.

When set to a value greater than 0:
- The plugin checks each player's last login time whenever any player joins the server
- For each shop owner, it calculates how many hours have passed since they last played
- If the calculated time exceeds the configured threshold, all of their shops are deleted
- A log message is generated for each deleted shop
- Shop files for that player are cleaned up if all shops are removed

When set to `0` (default):
- The auto-deletion feature is completely disabled
- Shops will remain indefinitely, regardless of how long players are inactive
- You'll need to manually remove shops from inactive players if desired

Common usage examples:
- `720` (30 days) - Reasonable for high-traffic servers with many temporary players
- `2160` (90 days) - More lenient setting for established communities
- `0` - No automatic deletion, ideal for servers where shop persistence is critical

This feature runs specifically when players join the server, making it a gradual cleanup process rather than a scheduled task that might cause server lag. It's a "set it and forget it" way to maintain server tidiness over time.

# Currency and Economy Settings

## currency
The type of currency used for shops.
```yaml
currency:
  type: 'ITEM'
  name: 'Emerald(s)'
  format: '[price] [name]'
```

This is one of the most important configurations in the Shop plugin as it determines how players will pay for transactions. The currency system has three components that work together:

### type
Defines which currency system the plugin will use:

- `ITEM`: Uses physical Minecraft items as currency (default is Emerald)
  - Players must have the specified item in their inventory to make purchases
  - Shop owners receive the actual items when their shops make sales
  - The currency item can be changed in-game using `/shop setcurrency` while holding the desired item
  - Ideal for servers that want to create an item-based economy
  - Can use any item, including custom/modded items with NBT data

- `VAULT`: Integrates with your economy plugin through the Vault API
  - Requires the Vault plugin and a compatible economy plugin (like Essentials, CMI, etc.)
  - Uses virtual currency from your economy plugin
  - Automatically withdraws/deposits from player balances
  - Best for servers with an established economy plugin
  - If Vault setup fails, the plugin will disable itself with an error message

- `EXPERIENCE`: Uses player experience points as currency
  - Players spend and earn actual XP when buying/selling
  - For offline players, XP data is stored in files to ensure transactions still work
  - Creates an interesting economy option without additional plugins
  - Note: This uses total experience points, not just levels

### name
This is the display name for the currency that appears on signs and in messages:

- For `ITEM`: Should describe the item (e.g., "Emerald(s)", "Diamond(s)")
- For `VAULT`: Typically a currency symbol (e.g., "$", "€", "£")
- For `EXPERIENCE`: Usually "Experience" or "XP"

The name is purely cosmetic and doesn't affect functionality, but should match your currency type for clarity.

### format
Controls how prices are displayed on signs and in messages:

- `[price] [name]`: Shows "5 Emerald(s)" or "5 Experience" (default format)
- `[name][price]`: Shows "Emerald(s)5" or "$5" (better for currency symbols)
- `[name] [price]`: Shows "Emerald(s) 5" or "$ 5" (with space)
- `[price][name]`: Shows "5Emerald(s)" or "5$" (no space)

For large numbers, the plugin can apply suffixes based on your `priceSuffixes` configuration (like 5k for 5,000).

The currency system is integral to all shop transactions, determining how players interact with the economy of your server. Most servers will want to align this with their overall economy approach - either item-based (common for survival/RPG servers) or Vault-based (common for established economy servers).

## allowPartialSales
This allows shops to sell partial stacks for a calculated partial rate if the shop is low on stock, or if the player only has partial funds. By default only the defined amount/price is allowed for a transaction, to allow partial sales you must changes this to `true`
```yaml
allowPartialSales: false
```

This important setting determines how flexible shop transactions can be when a player doesn't have enough currency to buy a full stack, or when a shop doesn't have enough items to sell a full stack.

When set to `true`:
- Players can buy fewer items than the shop's full stack amount if they don't have enough currency
- The price is automatically calculated based on the per-item rate (price ÷ amount)
- Players can buy from shops that don't have enough items for a full transaction
- Shop stock display is more accurate, showing "in stock" even if there's only partial inventory
- The price calculation rounds in favor of the item seller (not the currency spender)
- For sell shops with low stock: if a shop is selling 64 items for 16 emeralds but only has 32 items left, a player can buy those 32 items for 8 emeralds
- For buy shops with low funds: if a shop buys 64 items for 16 emeralds but only has 8 emeralds left, a player can sell 32 items for those 8 emeralds

When set to `false` (default):
- Only full transactions at exact price and amount are allowed
- Shops without enough stock for a complete transaction will show as "out of stock"
- Players without enough currency for a complete purchase cannot buy anything
- Shop owners without enough funds can't buy any items from players
- This creates a more rigid economy where prices are fixed and non-negotiable

The partial sales system is particularly useful for servers with item-based economies, where players might not always have exact amounts of currency. It also helps keep shops functional even when inventory is low.

### Technical Details
- For partial purchases, the price per item is calculated as: `originalPrice ÷ originalAmount`
- For items selling below 1 currency unit each (like 64 items for 10 emeralds), the system calculates `itemsPerPrice = 1 ÷ pricePerItem`
- The system always rounds slightly in favor of the item seller

## checkItemDurability
This will make it so shops will only complete transactions if the item durabilities are the same.
```yaml
checkItemDurability: true
```

This setting controls whether shops should take item durability (damage) into account when matching items for transactions. It's particularly important for tools, weapons, and armor that can be damaged through normal use.

When set to `true` (default):
- Shops will only accept items with the exact same durability as the sample item
- Players cannot sell damaged items to shops that are buying undamaged items
- Shops selling damaged items (like half-durability swords) will only sell at that specific durability
- This prevents players from selling near-broken items to shops and buying pristine ones
- The durability percentage is displayed in shop information and GUIs
- Useful for servers that want to enforce quality control in the economy

When set to `false`:
- Shops will ignore durability differences when matching items
- A player can sell a barely broken or nearly broken tool to a shop buying that tool type
- A shop selling tools will accept tools of any durability when restocking
- The plugin automatically handles durability metadata in the background to prevent NBT data issues
- This makes trading more flexible but can potentially be exploited

This setting mainly affects tools, weapons, and armor - items that have a durability bar. Regular items without durability (like blocks and most materials) are unaffected by this setting.

For servers focused on fair trading, keeping this enabled prevents durability-based exploits. For more casual servers, disabling it can make shop usage more convenient.

## ignoreItemRepairCost
This setting determines whether shops will complete transactions if the item "repair cost" is different, like with enchanted books or armor. The "repair cost" defines how many times an item has been combined in an anvil.
```yaml
ignoreItemRepairCost: true
```

This setting controls whether shops should take into account an item's "repair cost" when matching items for transactions. The repair cost is a hidden value that increases each time an item is worked on in an anvil, affecting the XP cost for future anvil work.

When set to `true` (default):
- Shops will ignore differences in repair cost when comparing items
- Players can sell items that have been previously repaired or combined in an anvil
- This is more player-friendly as most players aren't aware of the repair cost mechanic
- Particularly important for enchanted items, which often have repair costs from combining enchantments
- Useful for armor and tool shops where repair history shouldn't affect trading

When set to `false`:
- Shops will require items to have the exact same repair cost to be considered a match
- Players cannot sell items that have been worked on in an anvil if the shop is selling/buying "fresh" items
- This creates a more strict economy where item history matters
- Can prevent certain exploits but can be frustrating for players who don't understand why their items aren't accepted

This setting works by modifying how items are compared during shop transactions. When enabled, the plugin temporarily sets the repair cost to zero on both items during comparison, effectively making them match regardless of actual repair history.

Most servers should keep this enabled for a better player experience, as repair costs are usually not visibly apparent to players and can cause confusion when items don't seem to match for no obvious reason.

## creationCost
The amount of currency a player is charged to create a shop. By default there is no cost to create a shop, so if you would like to charge a fee, you can define it here.
```yaml
creationCost: 0
```

This setting allows server administrators to impose an economy-based restriction on shop creation by charging players a fee when they set up a shop. This can be useful for controlling shop proliferation and adding an economic cost to commerce on your server.

When set to a value greater than `0`:
- Players must pay the specified amount of currency when creating a shop
- The fee is charged in whatever currency type you've configured (items, Vault money, or experience)
- The payment is taken when the shop is initialized (when the item to be sold/bought is selected)
- For barter shops, the fee is only charged once the second item is selected
- If a player doesn't have enough funds, the shop creation process is canceled with an error message
- Players with the `shop.operator` permission bypass this cost

When set to `0` (default):
- No cost is associated with shop creation
- Any player with appropriate permissions can create shops without economic restriction

This setting can be used in conjunction with `returnCreationCost` to create a refundable deposit system, where players get their creation fee back when they properly close their shop.

Special considerations:
- For Vault-based economies, the fee is withdrawn directly from the player's balance
- For item-based economies, the required number of the currency item is removed from the player's inventory
- For experience-based economies, the player's XP is reduced accordingly
- The fee applies to each individual shop a player creates
- Operators and players with the `shop.operator` permission are exempt from this fee

For new servers, it's often best to start with a low value or zero to encourage economic activity, then adjust it upward if shop spam becomes an issue.

## destructionCost
The amount of currency a player is charged to destroy a shop.
```yaml
destructionCost: 0
```

This setting enables server administrators to impose a fee when players destroy their own shops. It works as a counterpart to the `creationCost` setting, creating economic controls around the entire shop lifecycle.

When set to a value greater than `0`:
- Players must pay the specified amount of currency to destroy a shop they own
- The fee is charged in whatever currency type you've configured (items, Vault money, or experience)
- If a player tries to destroy their shop without sufficient funds, the action is canceled with an error message
- The transaction only applies when destroying your own shops, not when removing other players' shops (with permissions)
- The cost is charged before the shop is actually destroyed

When set to `0` (default):
- No cost is associated with destroying shops
- Players can freely remove their shops without economic penalty

This setting can serve several purposes:
- Discouraging players from creating temporary shops that they quickly remove
- Encouraging more permanent shop placements and economic planning
- Creating a more thoughtful economy where shop placement has lasting consequences
- Generating a small "tax" that sinks currency out of the economy

Special considerations:
- Unlike the creation cost, there is no built-in way to return this cost to players
- Server operators and players with `shop.operator` permission can still destroy shops without paying this fee
- WorldGuard region owners can still destroy any shop in their region without cost
- Players with the `shop.destroy.other` permission can remove others' shops without paying this fee

Most servers will want to leave this at 0 unless you're specifically trying to discourage shop turnover.

## teleportCost
The amount of currency a player is charged to teleport to a shop (via the GUI)
```yaml
teleportCost: 0
```

This setting allows administrators to place an economic cost on the shop teleportation feature available through the GUI. By charging for teleportation, you can balance the convenience of instant shop access with economic gameplay.

When set to a value greater than `0`:
- Players must pay the specified amount each time they use the teleport feature in the GUI
- The fee is charged in whatever currency type you've configured (items, Vault money, or experience)
- If a player doesn't have enough funds, the teleport is canceled and an error message is displayed
- The cost is checked and charged before the teleport occurs
- The teleportation positions the player in front of the shop's sign, facing the shop
- Only players with appropriate permissions (`shop.gui.teleport` or `shop.operator`) can teleport, even if they can pay

When set to `0` (default):
- No cost is associated with shop teleportation
- Players with teleport permission can freely teleport to any shop through the GUI

This setting is particularly useful for:
- Balancing the convenience of teleportation against walking/traveling to shops
- Encouraging players to establish central shopping districts
- Preventing players from using shop teleports as free transportation across the map
- Creating another currency sink for the server economy

Special considerations:
- The teleport feature requires the GUI to be enabled (`enableGUI: true`)
- Players need the `shop.gui.teleport` permission to use this feature, regardless of cost
- This setting works well in combination with `teleportCooldown` to further regulate teleportation
- For item-based economies, players must have the currency items in their inventory

Most servers use this as a "convenience fee" if enabled, with the value typically set to represent a moderate but not prohibitive cost in your economy.

## teleportCooldown
The amount of time (in seconds) a player must wait between shop teleports
```yaml
teleportCooldown: 0
```

This setting implements a cooling-off period between shop teleportations, limiting how frequently players can use the teleport feature in the GUI. It works together with the `teleportCost` setting to regulate the shop teleportation system.

When set to a value greater than `0`:
- After teleporting to a shop, players must wait the specified number of seconds before teleporting again
- If a player attempts to teleport during the cooldown period, they'll receive a message showing how many seconds remain
- The cooldown is tracked per player, so each player has their own independent cooldown timer
- The teleport attempt is completely canceled if the player is still on cooldown
- Cooldown timers persist until they expire or the server restarts

When set to `0` (default):
- No cooldown restrictions are applied to shop teleportation
- Players with teleport permission can teleport to shops as frequently as they wish
- Only the `teleportCost` setting (if enabled) would limit teleportation frequency

This setting is useful for:
- Preventing players from rapidly teleporting across the server using shops
- Encouraging more deliberate and meaningful shop visits
- Reducing potential strain on the server from frequent teleportations
- Creating a more balanced teleportation system without making it prohibitively expensive

Common values include:
- `30` - A short cooldown that prevents rapid teleportation but doesn't significantly inconvenience players
- `60` - A moderate cooldown that encourages players to spend some time at each shop
- `300` (5 minutes) - A longer cooldown that makes teleportation a more significant decision
- `0` - No cooldown, suitable for servers with a teleport cost or other teleportation plugins

For the smoothest player experience, this setting should be balanced against your server's general philosophy on teleportation and travel. Lower values create convenience, while higher values promote more immersive gameplay.

## returnCreationCost
Should the player be refunded the creation cost when they destroy their own shop. By default players are not refunded their cost to create the shop. If you would like to refund players the creation cost, you can set this to true. This will either drop the item on the chest location if using `ITEM` currency, or deposit virtual funds if using `VAULT` currency.
```yaml
returnCreationCost: false
```

This setting determines whether players should receive a refund of their shop creation fee when they destroy their own shops. It creates a "deposit" system where the initial cost to establish a shop can be recovered when the player properly dismantles it.

When set to `true`:
- Players receive back the exact amount they paid as `creationCost` when they destroy their shop
- For Vault-based currencies, the refund is directly added to the player's economy balance
- For item-based currencies, the items are dropped at the shop's chest location
- The refund only applies to regular player-owned shops, not admin shops
- The refund is processed automatically during the shop destruction process
- The refund only happens if the `creationCost` setting is greater than 0

When set to `false` (default):
- No refund is given when shops are destroyed
- The creation fee is treated as a permanent economic cost
- This creates a stronger "sink" for your server's economy

This setting can serve several purposes:
- Encouraging players to properly destroy their shops rather than abandoning them
- Reducing the economic burden of shop relocation (destroy and rebuild elsewhere)
- Creating a system where shop space is "rented" rather than permanently purchased
- Allowing for more flexible economies where players frequently change shop types

Special considerations:
- This setting only has an effect if `creationCost` is set to a value greater than 0
- The refund is only given when players destroy their own shops, not when operators or others destroy them
- For item-based currencies, players should ensure they have inventory space or the items will drop on the ground
- This feature is completely independent from the `destructionCost` setting

Many servers find this useful to implement a "deposit" system where players get their initial investment back, making shop creation more of a temporary commitment of funds rather than a permanent expense.

## priceSuffixes
This setting controls how large numbers are formatted with suffixes on shop signs and in messages.
```yaml
priceSuffixes:
   minimumValue: 10000
   k:
      enabled: true
      value: 1000
   M:
      enabled: true
      value: 1000000
   B:
      enabled: true
      value: 1000000000
   T:
      enabled: true
      value: 1000000000000
   P:
      enabled: true
      value: 1000000000000000
   E:
      enabled: true
      value: 1000000000000000000
```

The `priceSuffixes` configuration offers an elegant solution for displaying large prices in a more readable format. Instead of showing "1000000" on signs and in messages, the plugin can display "1M" for improved readability and space efficiency.

### minimumValue
- Defines the threshold at which the plugin starts applying suffixes
- Prices below this value will be displayed normally (e.g., "9999")
- Prices at or above this value will use the appropriate suffix (e.g., "10k")
- Default is `10000`, meaning suffixes only apply to values of 10,000 or higher

### Suffix Entries
Each suffix entry (k, M, B, etc.) has two components:
- `enabled`: When `true`, this suffix will be used; when `false`, the suffix is ignored
- `value`: The numeric value this suffix represents (e.g., k = 1000, M = 1000000)

The plugin automatically selects the most appropriate suffix based on the price magnitude:
- A price of 15,000 would display as "15k"
- A price of 2,500,000 would display as "2.5M"
- A price of 3,250,000,000 would display as "3.25B"

### Decimal Precision
- For suffixed values, the plugin intelligently determines whether to show decimals
- Values are truncated to two decimal places maximum
- The plugin omits unnecessary decimal places (e.g., "5M" instead of "5.00M")
- Small fractional values maintain precision (e.g., "1.25k" for 1,250)

### Technical Details
- The system uses a NavigableMap to efficiently find the appropriate suffix for each value
- The formatting is applied consistently across all price displays including signs, GUI, and chat messages
- Players can also use these suffixes when manually entering prices (e.g., typing "5k" for 5,000)
- This feature works with all currency types (ITEM, VAULT, EXPERIENCE)

### Custom Configuration
Server owners can:
- Add or remove suffixes by modifying this section
- Change the value each suffix represents
- Adjust the minimum value threshold to control when suffixes appear
- Disable specific suffixes by setting `enabled: false`

This feature significantly improves user experience by making large numbers more readable and shop signs more compact, especially important on servers with inflated economies or high-value items.

# Shop Display

## displayType
The type of display that appears above shops.
```yaml
displayType: ITEM
```

This setting controls the default visual display that appears above shop containers (chests, barrels, etc.) to showcase the items being sold. The display helps players easily identify what items are being sold without needing to interact with the shop.

Available display types:
- `NONE`: No display is shown above the shop
- `ITEM`: A small floating item appears above the shop (default)
- `LARGE_ITEM`: A larger version of the item displayed via an armor stand
- `GLASS_CASE`: Item shown inside a glass case
- `ITEM_FRAME`: Item displayed in an item frame attached to the block above the shop

This setting defines the initial display style for all newly created shops. Players with the `shop.setdisplay` permission can later cycle through different display types using the action defined in `actionMappings.cycleShopDisplay` (default: Shift+Right-click on the shop chest).

For barter shops that exchange two different items, the display will show both items side by side.

Technical notes:
- Some display types require an empty block above the shop container
- The `ITEM_FRAME` type is not available for barter shops
- If a block above the shop is occupied, the plugin will either force the display to `NONE` (if `forceDisplayToNoneIfBlocked` is true) or prevent shop creation

## displayNameTags
This setting controls when floating text tags are shown above shops.
```yaml
displayNameTags: VIEW_SIGN
```

This setting determines how and when the shop's information hovers above the shop as floating text. These tags typically show details like item name, price, and stock status.

Available options:
- `NONE`: Never show floating text tags above shops
- `RIGHT_CLICK_CHEST`: Display tags temporarily when a player right-clicks the shop container
- `VIEW_SIGN`: Display tags temporarily when a player looks directly at the shop sign (default)

The tag information comes from the `displayConfig.yml` file, which can be customized with various placeholders like `[item]`, `[price]`, `[stock]`, and more.

The tags are shown only temporarily and will disappear after a short period or when the player looks away.

## displayCycle
This setting controls which display types are available when cycling through displays.
```yaml
displayCycle:
   - NONE
   - ITEM
   - GLASS_CASE
   - LARGE_ITEM
   - ITEM_FRAME
```

This setting defines the sequence of display types that players can cycle through when using the display cycle action (by default: Shift+Right-click on the shop chest). You can remove options from this list to limit which display types are available to players.

The order in the list determines the cycling sequence. For example, with the default configuration, if a shop currently has the `ITEM` display, cycling it would change to `GLASS_CASE`, then to `LARGE_ITEM`, and so on.

Special considerations:
- Players need the `shop.setdisplay` permission to cycle display types
- Operators can cycle displays on any shop, regular players only on their own shops
- The `ITEM_FRAME` type will be skipped for barter shops due to technical limitations
- If a shop has a block above it that prevents certain display types, the plugin will intelligently skip to compatible options

## forceDisplayToNoneIfBlocked
This setting controls whether shops can be created if the display is blocked.
```yaml
forceDisplayToNoneIfBlocked: true
```

When enabled, this setting allows shop creation even when there's a block above the shop container that would normally prevent displays from appearing.

When set to `true` (default):
- Shops can be created even if the space above the container is obstructed
- The display type is automatically set to `NONE` in these cases
- The shop will function normally but won't have a visual item display
- Players can still interact with the shop sign and container

When set to `false`:
- The plugin will prevent shop creation if the display would be blocked
- Players will receive an error message indicating that the display is blocked
- This enforces that all shops must have the ability to show a proper item display

This setting is particularly useful for underground shops or shops in tight spaces where visual displays may not be possible or desired.

## displayLightLevel
This setting controls the light level emitted by shop displays.
```yaml
displayLightLevel: 0
```

This setting determines the amount of light (0-15) emitted by shop displays, allowing shops to illuminate their surroundings. This feature is only available in Minecraft 1.17 and later versions.

- Range: 0-15 (0 = no light, 15 = maximum brightness like glowstone)
- Default: 0 (no light emission)
- Higher values make shops more visible in dark areas
- Light emits from the display itself, not the shop container

Setting this to values above 0 can be useful for underground shopping areas or night-time marketplaces, as it creates a visual highlight effect around shops.

## setGlowingItemFrame
This setting controls whether item frames used for shop displays are glowing.
```yaml
setGlowingItemFrame: false
```

When enabled, this setting applies a glowing effect to item frames used by the `ITEM_FRAME` display type, making them appear highlighted with an outline. This feature is only available in Minecraft 1.17 and later versions.

When set to `true`:
- Item frames used for shop displays will have a glowing outline effect
- This helps shops stand out visually, especially in busy areas
- The glow effect applies only to the frame, not the item inside

When set to `false` (default):
- Item frames appear normal without any special effects

This setting has no effect if you don't use the `ITEM_FRAME` display type or if your server is running on a version prior to Minecraft 1.17.

## setGlowingSignText
This setting controls whether shop sign text glows.
```yaml
setGlowingSignText: false
```

When enabled, this setting makes the text on shop signs appear to glow, providing better visibility. This feature is only available in Minecraft 1.17 and later versions.

When set to `true`:
- Text on shop signs will have a luminescent quality
- This improves readability in dark locations
- The glow applies to all text on the sign

When set to `false` (default):
- Sign text appears with normal brightness

Technical note: On Bedrock Edition clients, non-glowing sign text might appear dimmer rather than brighter due to rendering differences between Java and Bedrock editions.

# Shop Interactions

## actionMappings
This setting allows you to customize how players interact with shops by mapping specific actions to different click patterns.
```yaml
actionMappings:
  transactWithShop: 'RIGHT_CLICK_SIGN'
  transactWithShopFullStack: 'SHIFT_RIGHT_CLICK_SIGN'
  viewShopDetails: 'LEFT_CLICK_CHEST'
  cycleShopDisplay: 'SHIFT_RIGHT_CLICK_CHEST'
```

This powerful configuration option gives you complete control over the player interactions with shops. You can customize how players buy, sell, view details, and change the display type of shops.

The following actions can be mapped:
- `transactWithShop`: The primary interaction for buying/selling a single transaction worth of items
- `transactWithShopFullStack`: Buy/sell a full stack (64) of items at once for bulk transactions
- `viewShopDetails`: View detailed information about the shop (owner, stock, price per item)
- `cycleShopDisplay`: Change the visual display type that appears above the shop

Each action can be assigned to any of these click types:
```yaml
# Sign interactions
LEFT_CLICK_SIGN
SHIFT_LEFT_CLICK_SIGN
RIGHT_CLICK_SIGN
SHIFT_RIGHT_CLICK_SIGN

# Container interactions
LEFT_CLICK_CHEST
SHIFT_LEFT_CLICK_CHEST
RIGHT_CLICK_CHEST
SHIFT_RIGHT_CLICK_CHEST

# Special
NONE  # Disables the action completely
```

Setting any action to `NONE` will completely disable that functionality. For example, if you set `cycleShopDisplay: 'NONE'`, players and adminswon't be able to change shop displays at all, even with the correct permissions.

Technical details:
- For combo shops, the `transactWithShop` action works differently based on which side of the sign is clicked (buy or sell)
- The "chest" click types work on any container type (barrels, shulker boxes, etc.), not just chests
- Permissions still apply to restricted actions like `cycleShopDisplay` (requires `shop.setdisplay`)

## creationMethod
This setting determines the methods players can use to create shops.
```yaml
creationMethod:
   placeSign: true
   hitChest: true
```

Control how players can create shops with these two distinct creation methods:

### placeSign
When enabled (`true`), players can create shops by:
1. Placing a sign directly on a container (chest, barrel, etc.)
2. Writing `[Shop]` on the first line of the sign
3. Specifying the amount of items on the second line
4. Specifying the price on the third line
5. Specifying the shop type on the fourth line (buy, sell, barter, combo)
6. Punching the sign/container while holding the item they want to sell/buy

This is the traditional method of shop creation and is intuitive for experienced Minecraft shop plugin users.

### hitChest
When enabled (`true`), players can create shops by:
1. Shift+Left-clicking (punching) a container while holding an item
2. Following a step-by-step chat process that prompts for:
   - Shop type (buy, sell, barter, combo)
   - Item amount
   - Price
3. The plugin automatically creates a sign on the container

This guided approach is more beginner-friendly and ensures shops are created correctly.

Most servers enable both methods to accommodate player preferences, but you can disable either method if you prefer a consistent shop creation experience.

## displayFloatingCreateText
This setting controls whether floating instructions appear during shop creation.
```yaml
displayFloatingCreateText: true
```

When enabled, this setting shows helpful floating text guides above containers during the shop creation process.

When set to `true` (default):
- Temporary hologram-style text appears above containers during shop creation
- Step-by-step instructions guide players through the creation process
- Text changes based on the current step (selecting shop type, setting price, etc.)
- Instructions automatically disappear when the shop is created or the process is canceled

When set to `false`:
- No floating instructions appear during shop creation
- Players must rely on chat messages only for guidance

This feature is particularly useful for new players who are unfamiliar with the shop creation process. The floating text provides clear, contextual instructions exactly where they're needed.

## allowCreativeSelection
This setting allows players to select items from a creative-style menu when creating shops.
```yaml
allowCreativeSelection: true
```

This feature provides a creative inventory interface for selecting items when creating buy shops and combo shops, even in survival mode.

When set to `true` (default):
- Players can Shift+Left-click a container with an empty hand to access a creative inventory
- They can select any item from the creative inventory to use in their shop
- The selection only applies to the shop creation process and doesn't give actual creative mode
- For buy shops and combo shops, this allows players to create shops for items they don't currently possess
- Players' original inventory, gamemode, and location are restored after selection

When set to `false`:
- Players must physically possess the item they want to sell or buy
- No creative interface is available for item selection

This feature balances convenience with gameplay, making it easier to create buy shops without needing to obtain the item first. It's particularly useful for server admins setting up community shops.

## destroyShopRequiresSneak
This setting adds an extra safety measure when destroying shops.
```yaml
destroyShopRequiresSneak: false
```

This safety feature helps prevent accidental shop destruction by requiring players to sneak (hold the shift key) while breaking shop signs.

When set to `true`:
- Players must be sneaking (holding shift) to break a shop sign
- If a player tries to break a shop sign without sneaking, the action is canceled
- The sign remains intact, preventing accidental shop removal
- Applies to both owner and admin shop removal (if they have permissions)

When set to `false` (default):
- Shop signs can be broken normally without sneaking
- No additional protection against accidental shop destruction

This setting is recommended for servers where shop spaces are valuable or where players have reported accidentally destroying their shops while trying to interact with them.

## playSounds
This setting controls whether shops play sound effects during interactions.
```yaml
playSounds: true
```

This setting enables auditory feedback for shop interactions, enhancing the shopping experience with appropriate sound effects.

When set to `true` (default):
- Different sounds play based on shop interactions:
  - Creation: A positive "success" sound
  - Destruction: A breaking sound
  - Successful transaction: A cash register/exchange sound
  - Failed transaction: A negative "error" sound
- Sounds are only played to players involved in the interaction
- Sound selection is thematically appropriate to the action

When set to `false`:
- No sounds are played during any shop interaction
- Shop actions happen silently

Sound effects provide important feedback to players about the success or failure of their shop interactions. For servers running Minecraft versions before 1.9, this setting should be set to `false` as the sound API changed significantly in that version.

## playEffects
This setting controls whether shops display particle effects during interactions.
```yaml
playEffects: true
```

This setting enables visual particle effects for shop interactions, providing clear visual feedback.

When set to `true` (default):
- Different particle effects display based on shop interactions:
  - Creation: Positive green particles
  - Destruction: Red "angry" particles
  - Successful transaction: Green sparkles and smoke
  - Failed transaction: Red/dark particles
- Effects appear at the shop location

When set to `false`:
- No particle effects are shown during any shop interaction
- Shop actions happen without visual feedback

Visual effects help players quickly understand if their shop interaction was successful or not, especially in busy areas where chat messages might be missed. For servers running Minecraft versions before 1.9, this setting should be set to `false` as the particle API changed significantly in that version.

## inverseComboShops
This setting controls the layout of combo shop signs.
```yaml
inverseComboShops: false
```

Combo shops allow both buying and selling of the same item on a single sign, with different sides of the sign handling different transaction types. This setting determines which side of the sign corresponds to buy or sell functionality.

When set to `true`:
- The LEFT side of the sign is for BUYING items from players (shop buys)
- The RIGHT side of the sign is for SELLING items to players (shop sells)

When set to `false` (default):
- The LEFT side of the sign is for SELLING items to players (shop sells)
- The RIGHT side of the sign is for BUYING items from players (shop buys)

This setting affects both the physical clicking areas on the sign and the arrangement of information displayed on the sign. Most servers keep this as `false` for consistency with traditional shop plugins, but some servers may prefer the inverted arrangement.

## itemList
This setting restricts which items can be sold in shops.
```yaml
itemList: NONE
```

This powerful control option lets you limit which items players can sell in their shops, with three distinct modes:

Available options:
- `NONE`: No restrictions - all items can be listed in shops (default)
- `DENY_LIST`: All items except those specified in `itemList.yml` can be listed in shops
- `ALLOW_LIST`: Only items specified in `itemList.yml` can be listed in shops

Server owners can create and customize the `itemList.yml` file to define specific items that should be allowed or denied, depending on the selected mode.

This feature is useful for:
- Preventing economy exploits with certain items
- Reserving special/rare items for other game mechanics
- Creating a more balanced economy by restricting certain items
- Preventing problematic items (like bedrock, command blocks) from being traded

Note that operators and players with the `shop.operator` permission can bypass these restrictions and create shops with any item.

## worldBlacklist
This setting prevents shop creation in specified worlds.
```yaml
worldBlacklist:
  - 'world_nether'
  - 'world_the_end'
```

This setting allows you to completely disable shop creation in specific worlds. Players will not be able to create any type of shop in worlds listed here.

When a world is added to this list:
- Players cannot create shops in that world (sign placement will be canceled)
- Existing shops may still function if they were created before the world was blacklisted
- Players with the `shop.operator` permission can still create shops in blacklisted worlds

Common uses include:
- Preventing shops in PvP or survival challenge worlds
- Restricting economic activity to designated shopping worlds
- Keeping utility worlds (like resource worlds) free from permanent structures
- Preventing shops in worlds that may be reset periodically

Simply add the exact world name to the list to blacklist it. World names are case-sensitive and must match exactly.

## enabledContainers
This setting defines which block types can be used as shop containers.
```yaml
enabledContainers:
   - BARREL
   - CHEST
   - ENDER_CHEST
   - TRAPPED_CHEST
   - SHULKER_BOX
   - BLACK_SHULKER_BOX
   - BLUE_SHULKER_BOX
   - BROWN_SHULKER_BOX
   - CYAN_SHULKER_BOX
   - GRAY_SHULKER_BOX
   - GREEN_SHULKER_BOX
   - LIGHT_BLUE_SHULKER_BOX
   - LIGHT_GRAY_SHULKER_BOX
   - LIME_SHULKER_BOX
   - MAGENTA_SHULKER_BOX
   - ORANGE_SHULKER_BOX
   - PINK_SHULKER_BOX
   - PURPLE_SHULKER_BOX
   - RED_SHULKER_BOX
   - WHITE_SHULKER_BOX
   - YELLOW_SHULKER_BOX
```

This setting gives you fine-grained control over which container blocks can be used to create shops. You can add or remove container types from this list to control exactly which blocks can hold shop inventories.

By default, the following container types are enabled:
- `CHEST`: Standard chest blocks
- `TRAPPED_CHEST`: Trapped chests (generates redstone signal when opened)
- `BARREL`: Barrel blocks (added in 1.14)
- `ENDER_CHEST`: Ender chests for personal shops
- All 16 colored `SHULKER_BOX` variants plus the standard `SHULKER_BOX`

Key considerations for container types:
- **Chests**: The most common choice, unlimited storage
- **Trapped Chests**: Allow for redstone integration
- **Barrels**: Don't require space above them to open
- **Ender Chests**: Enable personal shop access from anywhere (inventory is tied to player)
- **Shulker Boxes**: Can be placed in any orientation

Changing this setting affects:
- Which blocks players can create shops on
- The plugin's internal container detection system
- Shop-finding algorithms

Removing a container type from this list will prevent new shops from being created on that block type, but existing shops may continue to function until they're broken.

# Database Logging & Notifications

## logging
Database logging for player Shop Actions & Transactions. Required for Offline Purchase Notifications to be sent, enabled by default with FILE database. Also helpful if you want to keep an eye out for potential issues or monitor shop activity.
```yaml
logging:
   type: "FILE"
   serverName: "127.0.0.1"
   databaseName: "shopdb"
   port: 3306
   user: "shop"
   password: "mysecurepassword"
   properties:
      - "useSSL=false"
```

This powerful feature allows server administrators to track, monitor, and analyze all shop activities and transactions on the server. It serves multiple purposes, including enabling offline purchase notifications, providing data for player notifications, and offering insights into the server's economy.

### type
Defines which database system the plugin should use for logging shop activity:

- `OFF`: Completely disables database logging and all features that depend on it, including offline purchase notifications
- `FILE`: (Default) Uses a lightweight embedded H2 database stored as files within the plugin directory
  - Requires no additional setup or external database
  - Perfect for small to medium-sized servers
  - Automatically manages data with minimal performance impact
  - Files are stored in the `plugins/Shop/database/` directory

- `MYSQL`: Uses a remote MySQL database for logging
  - Requires an existing MySQL server and database
  - Ideal for larger servers or server networks that want centralized logging
  - Allows for external access to shop data through standard database tools
  - Requires proper credentials and connection settings

- `MARIADB`: Uses a remote MariaDB database (MySQL fork) for logging
  - Functionally similar to MySQL but works with MariaDB servers
  - Configuration is identical to MySQL option

For servers using the default `FILE` option, no additional configuration is needed. The plugin will automatically create and manage the necessary database files.

For servers using `MYSQL` or `MARIADB`, you'll need to configure the following additional settings:

### serverName
The hostname or IP address of your MySQL/MariaDB server. Default is `127.0.0.1` (localhost).

### databaseName
The name of the database to use for shop data. The database must exist before the plugin starts. Default is `shopdb`.

### port
The port number the database server is listening on. Default MySQL/MariaDB port is `3306`.

### user
The username for authenticating with the database server.

### password
The password for authenticating with the database server.

### properties
A list of additional JDBC connection properties for fine-tuning the database connection. The default `useSSL=false` is sufficient for most setups, but you can add additional properties as needed.

### Data Collection
When enabled, the logging system collects the following data:
- Every shop action performed by players (timestamps, player info, action type)
- All transaction details (items, amounts, prices, locations)
- Shop creation, modification, and deletion events
- Player interactions with shops

This data is used to:
- Power the offline purchase notification system
- Track shop usage statistics
- Provide detailed transaction history for troubleshooting
- Enable server admins to monitor economic activity

The database implementation automatically manages connection pools efficiently and has minimal performance impact, even on busy servers.

## offlinePurchaseNotifications
Controls whether players will receive notifications about purchases that happened while they were offline.
```yaml
offlinePurchaseNotifications:
   enabled: true
```

This feature enhances the player experience by providing a detailed summary of all shop transactions that occurred while they were away from the server. When a player logs in, they'll receive an informative message showing profits, purchases, and shop status updates.

When set to `true` (default):
- Players receive a comprehensive notification upon login showing:
  - Number of transactions that occurred during their absence
  - Total profit earned from their shops
  - Total amount spent at other shops
  - Detailed breakdown of items sold and purchased (with quantities)
  - Notifications about any shops that ran out of stock
- The notification includes hover effects that show additional transaction details
- All information is calculated asynchronously to prevent login delays

When set to `false`:
- No offline transaction notifications are shown
- Players will need to check their shops manually to see if any transactions occurred

### Requirements
For offline purchase notifications to work:
- Database logging must be enabled (`logging.type` must be `FILE`, `MYSQL`, or `MARIADB`)
- If database logging is set to `OFF`, offline purchase notifications will be automatically disabled with a warning in the console

### Technical Details
The offline notification system:
- Collects data from the database when a player logs in
- Calculates totals and summaries asynchronously
- Formats messages based on templates in `chatConfig.yml`
- Uses hover-enabled text components for a rich user experience
- Processes notifications in the background without affecting server performance

This feature is particularly valuable for players who run shops on your server, as it gives them immediate feedback about their economic activity without requiring them to manually check each shop.

# Integrations

The Shop plugin offers several powerful integrations with popular Minecraft plugins to enhance functionality, improve protection, and provide visual representation of shops on map plugins.

## hookWorldGuard
Controls whether the Shop plugin integrates with WorldGuard for enhanced region-based shop protection.
```yaml
hookWorldGuard: false
```

This integration adds an extra layer of shop security by respecting WorldGuard regions and their protection flags:

- When `false` (default): The Shop plugin will respect WorldGuard's basic region protection flags (`passthrough`, `build`, and `chest-access`) but won't use the custom `allow-shop` flag. This means players can create shops anywhere they have permission to build and access chests according to WorldGuard's standard protection system.

- When `true`: In addition to respecting the basic protection flags, the plugin will also check for a custom WorldGuard flag called `allow-shop`. This gives server administrators more granular control over where shops can be created within protected regions.

### Technical Details
- When enabled, the plugin registers a custom WorldGuard flag called `allow-shop`
- Shop creation is checked against multiple protection mechanisms:
  - The player must have permission to build in the region
  - The player must have chest access in the region
  - The region must have the `allow-shop` flag set to allow (if set to `true`)
- Operators and players with the `shop.operator` permission can bypass these restrictions

This integration is particularly useful for servers with complex region management where you want to restrict commerce to specific areas

### Requirements
- WorldGuard plugin must be installed on your server
- The setting has no effect if WorldGuard is not present

### Example WorldGuard Commands

Here are practical examples of WorldGuard commands for configuring regions with different shop permissions:

```bash
# Create a default region (by default, has no passthrough permission)
# (Shop creation will be denied)
/rg define default_region

# Create a region with passthrough permission
# (Shop creation will be allowed if using default `hookWorldGuard: false`)
/rg define region_with_passthrough
/rg flag region_with_passthrough passthrough allow

# Create a region with both build and chest access
# (Shop creation will be allowed if using default `hookWorldGuard: false`)
/rg define region_with_build_and_chest_access
/rg flag region_with_build_and_chest_access build allow
/rg flag region_with_build_and_chest_access chest-access allow

# Create a region with the custom allow-shop flag
# (Shop creation will be allowed if `hookWorldGuard: true` is configured)
/rg define my_shop_region
/rg flag my_shop_region build allow
/rg flag my_shop_region chest-access allow
/rg flag my_shop_region allow-shop allow

# Create a region with chest access but no build access
# (Shop creation will be denied always - both permissions are required)
/rg define region_with_chest_access
/rg flag region_with_chest_access build deny
/rg flag region_with_chest_access chest-access allow

# Create a region with build access but no chest access
# (Shop creation will be denied always - both permissions are required)
/rg define region_with_build_access
/rg flag region_with_build_access build allow
/rg flag region_with_build_access chest-access deny

```

## hookTowny
Controls whether the Shop plugin integrates with Towny for town-based shop protection.
```yaml
hookTowny: false
```

This integration ensures that shops can only be created in appropriate locations within the Towny town system:

- When `false` (default): No special Towny integration is enabled. Players can create shops according to standard permission systems and other enabled protections.

- When `true`: The plugin enforces Towny's commercial plot system. Players can only create shops in:
  - Plots where they have explicit building permissions
  - Commercial plots within towns where they are residents
  - Their own residential plots

### Technical Details
- Shop creation checks use the Towny API's `ShopPlotUtil.doesPlayerHaveAbilityToEditShopPlot()` method
- This ensures compatibility with Towny's commercial plot system
- Operators and players with the `shop.operator` permission can bypass these restrictions
- Prevents players from creating shops in towns where they aren't residents

### Requirements
- Towny plugin must be installed on your server
- The setting has no effect if Towny is not present

## dynmap-marker
Controls the integration with the Dynmap plugin to display shops as markers on your server's dynamic map.
```yaml
dynmap-marker:
   enabled: false
   name: Shop
   preview: "[item](x[item amount]) - [shop type] - [price]"
   description: "Item: [item](x[item amount])<br />Owner: [owner]<br />Type: [shop type]<br />Price: [price]<br />Stock: [stock]<br />---------------<br />[location]<br />"
```

This integration allows players to see all shops on your server's Dynmap, making it easier for them to find what they're looking for:

- `enabled`: When set to `true`, shop markers will appear on your Dynmap
- `name`: The label shown for the marker set in Dynmap's layer control (default: "Shop")
- `preview`: The text shown when hovering over a shop marker on the map
- `description`: The HTML-formatted text shown when clicking on a shop marker

Both `preview` and `description` support the following placeholder variables:
- `[item]` - The item being sold/bought
- `[item amount]` - The quantity per transaction
- `[owner]` - The shop owner's name
- `[shop type]` - The shop type (BUY or SELL)
- `[price]` - The price per transaction
- `[stock]` - Current stock level
- `[location]` - The shop's location (world, x, y, z)

### Technical Details
- The plugin automatically updates markers when shops are created or destroyed
- Markers use the built-in "chest" icon from Dynmap
- Markers are grouped in a dedicated layer that can be toggled on/off in the Dynmap interface
- The integration has minimal performance impact as it updates markers asynchronously

### Requirements
- Dynmap plugin must be installed on your server
- The setting has no effect if Dynmap is not present

## bluemap-marker
Controls the integration with the BlueMap plugin to display shops as markers on your server's 3D map.
```yaml
bluemap-marker:
   enabled: false
   icon: "https://i.imgur.com/oCI3XJC.png"
   label: |
      <div style='background: rgba(0,0,0,0.7); color: #fff; font-size: 16px; padding: 5px; width: 200px; height: 140px;'>
        <div style='font-weight: bold; color: #fff; font-size: 20px;'>[item] x[item amount]</div>
        <div style='mt:80px;'>Owner: [owner]</div>
        <div style='mt:80px;'>Type: [shop type]</div>
        <div style='mt:80px; color: #7fca8c;'>Price: [price]</div>
        <div style='mt:80px;'>Stock: [stock]</div>
        <div style='mt:80px; color: #aaa; font-size: 20px;'>[location]</div>
      </div>
   minDistance: 0
   maxDistance: 500
```

This integration allows players to see all shops on your server's BlueMap, providing a beautiful 3D visualization:

- `enabled`: When set to `true`, shop markers will appear on your BlueMap
- `icon`: The URL to the icon image used for shop markers
- `label`: HTML-formatted content displayed when clicking a shop marker
- `minDistance`: Minimum distance (in blocks) at which markers become visible (0 = always visible)
- `maxDistance`: Maximum distance (in blocks) at which markers are visible

The `label` field supports the same placeholder variables as the dynmap integration:
- `[item]` - The item being sold/bought
- `[item amount]` - The quantity per transaction
- `[owner]` - The shop owner's name
- `[shop type]` - The shop type (BUY or SELL)
- `[price]` - The price per transaction
- `[stock]` - Current stock level
- `[location]` - The shop's location (world, x, y, z)

### Technical Details
- The plugin automatically updates BlueMap markers when shops are created or destroyed
- Markers are positioned precisely over the shop location
- The default icon is a chest image, but you can customize it with any web-accessible image
- Markers are organized in a dedicated layer per world called "Shops"
- The HTML label can be fully customized with CSS styling for a unique look
- The integration has minimal performance impact as it updates markers asynchronously

### Requirements
- BlueMap plugin must be installed on your server
- The setting has no effect if BlueMap is not present

## Automatic Integrations

The following plugins are automatically integrated when detected (no configuration needed):

- **LWC**: Protects shops from being broken into by non-owners & allows purchases to be made through protected chests
- **BentoBox**: Handles shop deletion when islands are reset or deleted
- **AdvancedRegionMarket (ARM)**: Handles shop deletion when regions are reset
- **PlotSquared**: Handles shop deletion when plots are reset or deleted
- **Vault**: Provides economy support for currency-based shops (required for VAULT currency type)

These integrations ensure that the Shop plugin works seamlessly with other popular server plugins without requiring additional configuration.

# Shop Performance Optimizations

This section contains settings that can be adjusted to optimize the plugin's performance on your server. These settings primarily affect how shop displays are processed and how the plugin searches for shops in the world.

## displayProcessInterval
How often (in seconds) to check for shop displays that need to be shown to players. Lower values make shop displays appear faster. You can increase this if you are experiencing performance issues to reduce the number of checks.
```yaml
displayProcessInterval: 1
```

This setting controls the frequency (in seconds) at which the plugin checks for and processes shop displays that should be shown to players. It directly affects how responsive the shop display system is and its impact on server performance.

When set to a lower value (like `1`, the default):
- Shop displays appear more quickly when a player moves near a shop
- More frequent checks are performed, which can be slightly more demanding on the server
- Players experience minimal delay when viewing/interacting with shops
- Optimal for most servers with a moderate number of shops

When set to a higher value (like `2` or `3`):
- Shop displays may take slightly longer to appear when players approach them
- Fewer checks are performed, reducing the CPU load on the server
- May reduce "micro-stutters" on servers with many shops
- Better for larger servers with hundreds of active shops

### Technical Details
- The plugin uses a scheduled task that runs every `displayProcessInterval` seconds
- During each run, it determines which shops should be visible to which players
- This task runs asynchronously to minimize impact on the main server thread
- The processing cost scales with the number of online players and active shops

### Recommendations
- For small servers (< 20 players, < 500 shops): `1` second is ideal
- For medium servers (20-50 players, 500-2000 shops): `1-2` seconds works well
- For large servers (50+ players, 2000+ shops): Consider `2-3` seconds
- If you notice server TPS drops when many players are near shops, try increasing this value

## displayMovementThreshold
How far a player needs to move (in blocks) before shop display checks should be processed. This prevents unnecessary processing when players are standing still.
```yaml
displayMovementThreshold: 1.0
```

This setting defines how far (in blocks) a player must move before the plugin recalculates which shop displays they should see. This optimization prevents the plugin from constantly rechecking displays when players are relatively stationary.

When set to a lower value (like `1.0`, the default):
- Shop displays are updated more responsively as players move
- More movement checks are performed, which can be slightly more CPU-intensive
- Better for servers where shop discovery is important
- Players see new shop displays after moving just a short distance

When set to a higher value (like `2.0` or `3.0`):
- Shop displays update less frequently as players move
- Fewer movement checks reduce CPU usage
- Better for servers with performance concerns
- Players may need to move a bit further before seeing new shop displays

### Technical Details
- The plugin tracks each player's last position where displays were processed
- When a player moves more than `displayMovementThreshold` blocks (in any direction) from that position, display calculations are triggered
- The check efficiently uses 3D Euclidean distance (X, Y, and Z coordinates)
- This works in conjunction with `displayProcessInterval` – movement is only checked at the interval frequency

### Recommendations
- For general gameplay: `1.0-2.0` blocks provides a good balance
- For performance-sensitive servers: `2.0-4.0` blocks reduces processing overhead
- For shop-focused servers (like markets/malls): Keep at `1.0` for responsive displays
- If players report shops appearing/disappearing abruptly, lower this value
- If your server experiences lag spikes when many players are moving around shops, increase this value

## maxShopDisplayDistance
Maximum distance (in blocks) at which shop displays will be shown to players. Mainly affects player performance, not server performance.
```yaml
maxShopDisplayDistance: 16.0
```

This setting controls the maximum distance at which a player can see shop displays (floating items, item frames, etc.). It primarily affects the client-side rendering load and visual experience rather than server performance.

When set to a lower value (like `12.0` or `16.0`, the default):
- Fewer shop displays are visible at once, reducing client-side rendering load
- Better performance for players with lower-end computers
- Shop displays "pop in" at closer distances
- Reduces visual clutter in dense shop areas

When set to a higher value (like `24.0` or `32.0`):
- Shop displays are visible from further away, helping players locate shops
- Players can see more shops at once, improving shop discovery
- May reduce the "pop-in" effect as players move through the world
- Can increase client-side rendering load in areas with many shops

### Technical Details
- This value is used to filter out shop displays that are too far away from a player
- The distance calculation is performed on the server, so distant displays are never sent to clients
- Entity culling is still applied by the client based on their render distance settings
- The Minecraft client's default entity render distance is approximately 20 blocks
- Setting values higher than the client's entity render distance will still "prepare" displays that come into range

### Recommendations
- For general gameplay: `16.0` blocks provides a good balance (default)
- For performance-focused servers: `10.0-12.0` blocks improves client performance
- For shopping district emphasis: `24.0-32.0` blocks improves shop visibility and discovery
- Consider your server's shop density – higher values have more impact in densely packed shop areas
- Note that custom resource packs or client mods might affect how this setting performs

## shopSearchRadius
Radius (in chunks) around a player to search for shops. Each increment searches exponentially more chunks (1=3x3 area, 2=5x5 area, etc).
```yaml
shopSearchRadius: 1
```

This setting determines how far (in chunks) the plugin searches for shops around a player. This is a critical performance setting that directly affects how many chunks are scanned when looking for nearby shops, with each increment significantly increasing the search area.

When set to `1` (default):
- Searches a 3×3 chunk area centered on the player (9 chunks total)
- Very efficient, even on servers with many shops
- Works well for most gameplay scenarios
- Players need to be relatively close to shops to interact with them

When set to `2`:
- Searches a 5×5 chunk area centered on the player (25 chunks total)
- Somewhat higher CPU usage, especially with many shops
- Players can interact with shops from further away
- Useful for larger shop buildings that might span multiple chunks

When set to `3` or higher:
- Searches a 7×7 chunk area or larger (49+ chunks total)
- Moderately higher CPU usage
- Generally not recommended unless absolutely necessary
- May be useful in very specific server configurations (i.e. YouTube/Streamer servers)

### Technical Details
- Search area grows as (2×radius+1)² in chunks
- The search is performed very efficiently using spatial hash maps
- Chunk radius calculation starts from the chunk the player is currently in
- Search is performed when players move, every `displayProcessInterval` seconds
- This setting does not affect display visibility, only shop interaction distance

### Search Area by Radius Value
| Radius | Chunk Area | Approx. Block Area |
|--------|------------|-------------------|
| 1      | 3×3 (9)    | 48×48 blocks      |
| 2      | 5×5 (25)   | 80×80 blocks      |
| 3      | 7×7 (49)   | 112×112 blocks    |
| 4      | 9×9 (81)   | 144×144 blocks    |

### Recommendations
- For most servers: Keep at the default value of `1`
- For servers with very large shop structures: Consider `2`
- Never set higher than `3` without careful testing
- If players report inability to interact with distant parts of their shop, increase to `2`
- If you experience server lag when players use shop commands or interact with shops, decrease to `1`

### Performance Impact
The shop search process is one of the most resource-intensive operations in the plugin, particularly on servers with thousands of shops. Each increment in radius exponentially increases the number of chunks that must be searched, which can significantly impact performance during shop interactions.

The plugin uses highly optimized data structures to minimize this impact, but setting an appropriate `shopSearchRadius` is still crucial for maintaining server performance.

# Debug Tools

This section contains settings that help server administrators troubleshoot issues, optimize performance, and enable special functionality for testing or specific use cases. Most servers should keep these settings at their default values unless actively diagnosing problems.

## logLevel
Controls the amount of information logged by the plugin. Useful for troubleshooting.
```yaml
logLevel: HELPFUL
```

This setting determines how verbose the plugin's logging will be in the server console and log files. Higher log levels provide more detailed information but can generate significantly larger log files and potentially impact performance when set to the highest levels.

The available log levels, from least to most verbose:

- `INFO`: Basic logging that only shows critical information
  - Plugin startup and shutdown messages
  - Error messages and warnings
  - Configuration problems
  - Essential server notifications
  - Best for normal operation on production servers

- `NOTICE`: Adds logging for significant system events
  - Shop creation and deletion events
  - Player-triggered admin actions
  - Database connections and disconnections
  - Useful for monitoring general plugin activity

- `HELPFUL` (Default): Adds logging for important player interactions
  - Shop transactions (purchases and sales)
  - Helpful information about settings

- `DEBUG`: Adds detailed troubleshooting information
  - Logs messages sent/displayed to players (in color!)
  - Shop processing logic
  - Display handling
  - Performance metrics
  - Useful when diagnosing specific issues

- `TRACE`: Adds step-by-step operation logging
  - Method entry and exit points
  - Variable state changes
  - Detailed execution flow
  - For advanced debugging only
  - Can significantly increase log size

- `SPAM`: Extremely verbose diagnostics
  - Internal calculations
  - Every player movement check
  - All shop processing events
  - Will rapidly generate lots of log files

- `HYPER`: Maximum possible logging detail
  - Lots of logs for some function calls related to the plugin
  - Raw data processing
  - For developer use only
  - Only use briefly when requested by support

### Recommendations
- For normal server operation: Use `HELPFUL`
- When troubleshooting specific issues: Use `DEBUG`
- When working with plugin developers on a bug: Use `TRACE` or higher as directed
- After resolving issues: Return to `HELPFUL` to avoid performance impacts and large log files

## enableLogColor
Enables or disables colored output in the console log. Cuz it looks cool.
```yaml
enableLogColor: false
```

This setting controls whether the plugin uses ANSI color codes to highlight different types of log messages in the server console. When enabled, log messages will be color-coded based on their severity and type, making it easier to identify warnings, errors, and important information at a glance.

When set to `true`:
- Log messages are color-coded in the console
- Errors appear in red
- Warnings appear in yellow
- Information messages appear in different shades of white/gray
- Debug messages and lower appear in shades of grey
- Makes it easier to visually scan logs for issues

When set to `false` (default):
- All log messages appear in the console's default text color
- No special formatting is applied
- Better compatibility with console environments that don't support ANSI color codes
- Prevents potential display issues in some server management panels

### Technical Details
- Color codes are implemented using standard ANSI escape sequences
- Some server hosting panels may not properly display colored logs
- Console colors have no effect on log files, only the live console display
- No performance impact either way

### Recommendations
- If you're running the server directly in a terminal: Enable this for better readability
- If you're using a hosting panel: Test to see if colors display correctly
- If you're experiencing odd characters in your console: Disable this feature

## debug
Advanced debug settings for troubleshooting or special use cases.
```yaml
debug:
   allowUseOwnShop: false
   transactionDebugLogs: false
   shopCreateCooldown: 5000
   forceResaveAll: false
```

This section contains specialized settings used for testing, debugging, and special situations. Most of these settings should remain at their defaults unless you have a specific reason to change them.

### allowUseOwnShop
Controls whether players can use their own shops.

When set to `true`:
- Shop owners can buy from their own sell shops and sell to their own buy shops
- This bypasses the normal restriction preventing self-transactions
- Useful for testing shop functionality without requiring a second player
- Can potentially be used to exploit certain game mechanics (e.g., quick item transfers)
- May enable inventory manipulation that circumvents normal gameplay limitations

When set to `false` (default):
- Players cannot buy from or sell to their own shops
- Enforces proper shop usage through legitimate player-to-player trading
- Prevents potential economy exploits
- Ensures shops function as intended for commerce between different players

This setting is primarily designed for testing and development environments. On production servers, enabling this setting could potentially lead to weird things.

### transactionDebugLogs
Controls whether detailed transaction information is logged during shop transactions.

When set to `true`:
- Detailed price calculation information is logged for every shop transaction
- Shows exactly how prices are calculated for partial transactions
- Displays item matching data and durability checks
- Useful for troubleshooting issues with specific items or shops
- Can generate a large volume of logs if many transactions occur

When set to `false` (default):
- Only standard transaction information is logged (based on the `logLevel` setting)
- Price calculation details are omitted
- Reduces log verbosity for normal operation

This setting is particularly useful when:
- Troubleshooting issues with specific transaction types
- Verifying price calculations for partial sales
- Diagnosing problems with custom items or NBT data
- Investigating player reports about incorrect pricing

The logs produced when this option is enabled are highly technical and intended for administrators who need to diagnose specific transaction problems.

### shopCreateCooldown
Controls the minimum time (in milliseconds) between shop creation attempts by a player.

```yaml
shopCreateCooldown: 5000
```

This setting prevents players from spamming shop creation commands or accidentally triggering multiple shop creation processes simultaneously. It defines how many milliseconds must pass before a player can initiate another shop creation process.

- Default value: `5000` (5 seconds)
- Lower values allow more rapid shop creation
- Higher values enforce a longer waiting period between shop creations
- Doesn't affect shop interactions, only the initiation of new shop creation

This setting helps prevent:
- Accidental double shop creation
- Server load from rapid creation attempts
- Potential shop placement exploits
- Chat spam from shop creation messages

For most servers, the default value provides a good balance between preventing spam and allowing convenient shop setup. If players report issues with shop creation being unresponsive, ensure this value isn't set too high. Only lowered mainly in our testing scripts.

### forceResaveAll
Controls whether all shops should be forcibly resaved during server startup.

When set to `true`:
- Every shop is loaded and immediately resaved when the server starts
- Forces the conversion of old item formats to the current format
- Can fix shops with corrupted or outdated NBT data
- Updates item storage format for compatibility with newer Minecraft versions
- May significantly increase server startup time on servers with many shops

When set to `false` (default):
- Shops are loaded normally during server startup
- No forced resaving occurs
- Server startup proceeds at normal speed

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: ALWAYS CREATE A FULL BACKUP BEFORE ENABLING THIS OPTION**

This setting should only be enabled when:
- Updating from a very old version of the plugin
- After a major Minecraft version update that changed item formats
- When instructed by plugin support staff
- If you're experiencing widespread issues with shop items not displaying correctly

After enabling this option and restarting once, you should immediately set it back to `false` to prevent unnecessary processing on subsequent restarts.

### Technical Details
The force resave process:
- Loads every shop from storage
- Re-serializes all items with current NBT formats
- Updates any legacy item data structures
- Overwrites existing shop files with newly formatted versions
- Logs each conversion for verification

This is a powerful maintenance tool that should be used with caution, as it makes permanent changes to your shop data files. In rare cases, if the conversion process encounters severely corrupted data, it might result in item data loss.
