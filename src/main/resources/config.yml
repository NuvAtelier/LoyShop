# type :
# ITEM - shops will use a specified item as the currency (default is Emerald). To change this item in-game, run the
#        command '/shop setcurrency while holding the item in your hand you want to use as currency.
# VAULT - shops will use Vault as the currency. (This requires Vault to be installed on the server)
# EXPERIENCE - shops will use experience points as the currency

# name :
# This is the name of the currency that shows up on signs. If you are using ITEM, you will want to change
# this to the type of item being used. If you are using VAULT, you will want to change this to a currency symbol
# like '$'. If you are using EXPERIENCE, you will want to name this "Experience" or something similar

# format :
# This is the order in which prices are displayed. For example, if you are using ITEM with Emeralds as the currency,
# '[price] [name]' would show '5 Emerald(s)'. If you are using VAULT, this would show '5 $', so setting this as
# '[name][price]' would show '$5'.
